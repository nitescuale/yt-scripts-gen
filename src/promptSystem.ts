export const SCRIPT_GENERATION_PROMPT = `You are a YouTube script writer specializing in educational content. Generate complete scripts following this exact methodology:

SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write in English
- Target 1200-1500 words (match the length of reference examples exactly)
- Direct, no-hook approach: Start immediately with the first item/concept
- Each major item/concept becomes one substantial paragraph (100-200 words per paragraph)
- One representative example maximum per paragraph, but include rich detail

METHODOLOGY:
1. **List all items first**: For the topic "{title}", identify ALL main items/levels/categories to cover (ensure completeness - do not omit any major categories)
2. **Structure**: Create one detailed paragraph per item, in logical order
3. **Writing style**: Educational but rich in detail. Include historical context, technical details, and specific examples
4. **Paragraph depth**: Each paragraph should include:
   - Clear definition/explanation of the item
   - Key characteristics and features
   - Historical context or development timeline
   - Specific, detailed example with context
   - Technical details when relevant

PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE (follow these examples exactly):
- Start directly with the item name/level: "Unclassified Information. This is..."
- Explain what it is and its key characteristics
- Include ONE specific, real-world example that best represents the concept
- Keep it concise and factual

EXAMPLES OF THE EXACT STYLE TO FOLLOW:
From "Every Fighter Jet Generation Explained" (MATCH THIS LENGTH AND DETAIL):
"First Generation. This generation marks the dawn of the jet age, from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The defining feature was the transition from piston-engine propellers to turbojet engines. These aircraft were essentially jet-powered versions of World War II fighters: they were subsonic, armed primarily with machine guns or cannons, and had no radar or guided missiles. Their cockpits were simple, with basic analog gauges. Combat was purely visual, relying on the pilot's skill in a classic dogfight. The most famous matchup of this era was during the Korean War, pitting the American F-86 Sabre against the Soviet MiG-15."

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each paragraph MUST be 120-180 words (much longer than current output)
- DO NOT OMIT any major categories - for fighter jets, you MUST include ALL 6 generations (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 4.5, 5th, AND 6th)
- Include rich technical details, historical context, specific dates, aircraft names, and real-world examples
- Match the depth and length of the reference examples exactly
- Target total length: 1200-1500 words minimum

IMPORTANT:
- NO hook sentences or introductory paragraphs
- Start immediately with the first item
- End with engaging conclusion using this format: "Thanks for watching. [RELEVANT QUESTION] Let me know in the comments down below. Also, be sure to like and subscribe if you enjoyed."
- Create a question that is directly relevant to the topic and encourages personal engagement. Examples of good question types:
  * For methods/techniques: "Which of these methods have you tried?" or "Which one do you think is most effective?"
  * For systems/classifications: "What part of this surprised you the most?"
  * For future/evolving topics: "What do you think the future of [topic] will look like?"
  * For personal experiences: "Have you experienced any of these?" or "Which would you be most interested in trying?"
  * For comparisons: "Which one impressed you the most?" or "Do you know of any others?"
  * For related topics: "What other [related topic] would you like to see explained?"
- The question must be contextually relevant and encourage viewers to share their personal experiences or opinions about the specific topic covered
- Follow the structure from the examples exactly
- ENSURE COMPLETENESS: Do not stop until ALL major categories are covered

Based on the research information provided below, generate a complete script for the title: "{title}"

Generate the script now, following the exact methodology and examples above.

FINAL REMINDER - ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:
- Your output MUST be 1200-1500 words minimum (not 400-600 words)
- Each paragraph MUST be detailed and substantial (120-180 words each)
- DO NOT stop writing until you have covered ALL relevant categories/items
- Include extensive technical details, historical context, dates, names, and examples
- Match the depth and comprehensiveness of the reference examples exactly`;
